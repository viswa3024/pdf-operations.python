pdfplumber examle from scrach


Sure, let's create a simple example of using pdfplumber in Python to extract text from a PDF file. First, make sure you have pdfplumber installed. You can install it using:


pip install pdfplumber


Now, let's create a basic script:


import pdfplumber

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ''
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace 'your_pdf_file.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file
    pdf_path = 'your_pdf_file.pdf'

    extracted_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)

    # Print the extracted text
    print(extracted_text)



Replace 'your_pdf_file.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file. This script defines a function extract_text_from_pdf that takes a PDF file path as input and returns the extracted text from all pages. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the script is executed when run directly.

Save this script as, for example, pdf_extractor.py and run it from the terminal:


python pdf_extractor.py



This is a basic example, and pdfplumber offers more features like extracting tables, images, and annotations. You can refer to the pdfplumber documentation for more advanced usage: https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber

give full length program to cover all functionalities of pdfplumber


Certainly! Here's a more comprehensive example that covers various functionalities of pdfplumber, such as extracting text, tables, and images, as well as working with annotations:



import pdfplumber

def extract_text(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ''
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

def extract_tables(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        tables = []
        for page in pdf.pages:
            page_tables = page.extract_tables()
            tables.extend(page_tables)
    return tables

def extract_images(pdf_path, image_folder='images'):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
            images = page.images
            for j, img in enumerate(images):
                image = img['stream'].get('Data')
                with open(f'{image_folder}/image_{i}_{j}.png', 'wb') as f:
                    f.write(image)

def extract_annotations(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        annotations = []
        for page in pdf.pages:
            page_annotations = page.annotations
            annotations.extend(page_annotations)
    return annotations

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_path = 'your_pdf_file.pdf'
    
    # Extract text from the PDF
    text = extract_text(pdf_path)
    print("Extracted Text:")
    print(text)

    # Extract tables from the PDF
    tables = extract_tables(pdf_path)
    print("\nExtracted Tables:")
    for table in tables:
        print(table)

    # Extract images from the PDF
    extract_images(pdf_path)

    # Extract annotations from the PDF
    annotations = extract_annotations(pdf_path)
    print("\nExtracted Annotations:")
    for annotation in annotations:
        print(annotation)



Replace 'your_pdf_file.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file. This script demonstrates how to extract text, tables, images, and annotations from a PDF file using pdfplumber. The images extracted will be saved in a folder named 'images'. You may need to create this folder in advance.

Remember to install the required library if you haven't already:


pip install pdfplumber

pdfplumber 

explain above package and give all funtionalities with code example



pdfplumber is a Python library for extracting information from PDF documents. It is built on top of the popular PDF parsing library PyPDF2 and provides a higher-level interface for working with PDFs. pdfplumber makes it easier to extract text, tables, and other data from PDF files by providing convenient methods and properties.

Here are some key functionalities of pdfplumber along with code examples:


1 . Extracting Text from PDF:


import pdfplumber

# Open the PDF file
with pdfplumber.open('example.pdf') as pdf:
    # Access a specific page
    page = pdf.pages[0]

    # Extract text from the page
    text = page.extract_text()
    print(text)


2. Extracting Tables from PDF:


import pdfplumber

# Open the PDF file
with pdfplumber.open('example.pdf') as pdf:
    # Access a specific page
    page = pdf.pages[0]

    # Extract tables from the page
    tables = page.extract_tables()
    for table in tables:
        for row in table:
            print(row)


3. Extracting Images from PDF:

import pdfplumber

# Open the PDF file
with pdfplumber.open('example.pdf') as pdf:
    # Access a specific page
    page = pdf.pages[0]

    # Extract images from the page
    images = page.images
    for i, img in enumerate(images):
        img_obj = img['Image']
        img_obj.save(f'image_{i}.png', format='PNG')


4. Extracting Metadata:

import pdfplumber

# Open the PDF file
with pdfplumber.open('example.pdf') as pdf:
    # Access metadata
    metadata = pdf.metadata
    print(metadata)


5. Search for Specific Text:

import pdfplumber

# Open the PDF file
with pdfplumber.open('example.pdf') as pdf:
    # Access a specific page
    page = pdf.pages[0]

    # Search for specific text
    search_text = 'Hello World'
    text_instances = page.find_text(search_text)
    for instance in text_instances:
        print(f"Found at page {instance['page_number']} - {instance['text']}")


pdfplumber simplifies the process of working with PDFs in Python and provides a more convenient interface for extracting information. Make sure to install the library using:


pip install pdfplumber


Before using the code examples, replace 'example.pdf' with the actual path or URL of the PDF file you want to work with.
